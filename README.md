# Hotel Booking Cancellation (Report)

## Problem Statement -

In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced high rates of cancellations, leading to significant challenges such as reduced revenue and suboptimal utilization of hotel rooms. To address these issues, both hotels are focusing on strategies to decrease cancellation rates to enhance their revenue generation efficiency. This report aims to analyze the factors contributing to hotel booking cancellations and other elements that do not affect their annual revenue generation, providing comprehensive business insights to mitigate these issues.

## Assumptions 

1. There were no significant events between 2015 and 2017 that would notably affect the data being used.
2. The information remains relevant and can be utilized to effectively analyze potential plans for the hotel.
3. There are no unforeseen drawbacks associated with the hotel implementing any recommended strategy.
4. The hotels have not yet adopted any of the proposed solutions.
5. The primary factor impacting income generation is booking cancellations.
6. Cancellations lead to rooms remaining vacant for the duration they were booked.
7. Clients typically cancel hotel reservations within the same year they initially made them.

## Research Question 

1. What variables are affecting hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can we reduce the hotel reservation cancellations?
3. How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## Hypothesis

1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. When there is longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
3. Majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.

# Analysis and Findings

The above bar graph shows the number of reservations that are canceled and not canceled. While it is evident that a significant amount of bookings are not canceled, 37% of reservations that are canceled is still an important number as it is impacting the hotel's earnings.

City hotels have more reservations than resort hotels. There's a chance that resort hotels cost more than city hotels.

The accompanying line graph illustrates how the average daily rate for a city hotel can be less than that of a resort hotel on some days and much lower on others. Naturally, rates for resort hotels may increase on weekends and holidays.

August and July are peak months with high booking stability, particularly in July. Most number of cancelation is observed in January, followed by July and February. Lowest cancelations are in August & September. November and December have the fewest reservations, suggesting a potential off-peak season or lower demand.

With January having the highest ADR, followed by July and February, this bar graph illustrates that cancellations occur more frequently during periods of high prices and less frequently during periods of low pricing. In this case, August and September had the lowest ADR.

Looking at the pie chart, we can see that Portugal has the highest amount of cancellations (70%). 


Let's now investigate which reservation method has the largest number of cancellations among visitors.

Among all the customers who cancel their reservations, approximately 46% are clients who book through online travel agencies, and 27% are from group bookings. In contrast, only 4% of cancellations occur when guests book directly by visiting the hotel.

As seen in the graph above, more reservations are canceled when the average daily rates are higher than when they are lower. It strongly supports the hypothesis that a greater price leads to more cancellations.

Let us see if the cutomers tend to cancel more frequently if there is a longer waiting list

Longer waiting periods (more than 30 days) have been linked with greater cancellation rates, as shown in the graph. This suggests that customers may be unwilling to wait for extended periods of time and are more likely to cancel their bookings if they have to wait longer than a month.
Shorter waiting times (less than 30 days) are linked to reduced cancellation rates, implying that customers are more likely to keep their bookings if they do not have to wait as long.

## Suggestions

1. As cancellation rates increase with higher prices, hotels can focus on refining their pricing strategies. Lowering rates for specific locations and offering discounts can help retain reservations and reduce cancellations.
2. Since the cancellation rate is higher for resort hotels compared to city hotels, offering reasonable discounts on room prices during weekends or holidays can help attract more bookings and reduce cancellations.
3. With the highest cancellation rates in January, hotels can launch targeted marketing campaigns or promotions during this month to boost revenue and reduce cancellations.
4. Improving the quality of hotels and services, particularly in Portugal, can help decrease cancellation rates. Enhancing the customer experience can encourage guests to follow through with their reservations.
5. Offer special discounts or promotions to customers who are willing to wait longer for their reservations. This can motivate them to stay on the waiting list instead of canceling.
6. Consider implementing a policy of partial refunds for cancellations, which might deter cancellations while still providing some compensation for customers.
